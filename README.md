"# Desktop-Based-Video-Chat-Application" 
Project is a desktop-based video chatting system using OpenCV and Java socket programming.
The user is able to mute or switch off their video based on their request or end call if required.
The application has a client-server system structure where data is passed through data streams.
When sockets get connected, we can pass audio as well as video data and clients can interact.
